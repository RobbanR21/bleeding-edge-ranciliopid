# ranciliopid - Open source PID for your espresso machine

BLEEDING EDGE MASTER VERSION 

Version 2.7.0 beta 1

forked of the Rancilio-Silvia PID for Arduino described at http://rancilio-pid.de.

## Support / Contact
You can chat with us directly using our [discord server](https://discord.gg/VA5ZeacFdw).

## Most important features compared to rancilio-pid master:
1. New PID Controller "Multi-state PID with steadyPower (Bias)"
   - Target-Temperature for brewing and steaming (!) is automatically controlled by PID.
   - Auto-Tuning of all PID settings. No knowledge or special tunings required.
   - Distinct PID settings dependend on the current "state" of the machine. 
   - Most of the settings are either static or semi-automatically tuned, which does not require an PHD (German: Diplom) to understand.
   - Currently 5 states are implemented:
     - Coldstart (machine is cold)
     - Coldstart stabilisation (directly after coldstart)
     - Inner Zone (temperature near setPoint)
     - Outer Zone (temperature outside of "inner zone")
     - Brewing
     - Steaming (!)
   - steadyPower is introduced which compensates the constant temperature loss due to environment
   - steadyPowerOffset is introduced which compensates the increased temperature loss when the machine (brew head etc.) is still very cold.
   - PidController offers feature like I-value filtering, special handling of setPoint crossings and more (hard-coded)
   - PID Controller is now integral part of the software and not an external library.
1. actionController, which allow you to trigger custom functions over any GPIO port and/or mqtt.
   - fully dynamic mapping of any(!) available analog/digital gpio port to custom functions, which are currently:
     - BREWING   := start brewing
     - STEAMING  := automatically manages heat up machine for steaming
     - HOTWATER  := start pouring hotwater
     - HEATER    := activate heater (not yet)
     - PUMP      := activate pump (not yet)
     - VALVE     := activate Valve  (not yet)
     - CLEANING  := activate cleaning mode (not yet)
     - TEMP_INC  := increase setPoint (not yet)
     - TEMP_DEC  := decrease setPoint (not yet)
   - while also supporting the switch types: toggles (eg switches) and triggers (eg push buttons)
   - added MQTT Support to control actions using topics ../actions/<ACTION> with supported payloads of 0|1|-1 (off|on|switch)
     Example: "custom/KÃ¼che.Rancilio2/actions/STEAMING"
1. Freely choose if you want the software to use WIFI, BLYNK and/or MQTT. Everythink can be enabled/disabled and still have a flawlessly working PID controller.
1. Additionally if you want to to depend on a remotely running service (eg. blynk server on raspi), you can activate a MQTT-Server on the arduino itself!
1. Offline Modus is fixed and enhanced. If userConfig.h's FORCE_OFFLINE is enabled, then PID fully is working without networking. Ideal in situations when there is no connectivity or you dont want to rely on it.
1. Huge performance tunings and improvements under the hood which stabilizes the system (eg in situations of bad WIFI, hardware issues,..).
1. MQTT support to integrate machine in smart-home solutions and to easier extract details for graphing/alerting.
1. Added RemoteDebug over telnet so that we dont need USB to debug/tune pid anymore (https://github.com/JoaoLopesF/RemoteDebug). While using OTA updates you can remotely debug and update the software!
1. "Brew Ready" Detection implemented, which detects when the temperature has stabilized at setPoint. It can send an
   MQTT event or have hardware pin 15 triggered (which can be used to turn a LED on).
1. All heater power relevant settings are now set and given in percent (and not absolute output) and therefore better to understand
1. Support for customizable item collections to beautify display output (thanks to helge!)
1. Safetly toogle added to shutdown heater on sensor malfunction (TEMPSENSORRECOVERY)
1. Many useful functions to be used internally getAverageTemperature(), pastTemperatureChange() + updateTemperatureHistory())

## ATTENTION:
- This software is tested thoroughly with the pid-only hardware solution on Silvia 5e, and with a permanently run full-hardware solution on an 10 year old Silvia. Also a 10 year old Gaggia Classic is tested successfully. I am grateful for any further feedback. 
- Please monitor our machine's temperature closely the first few run times. The muti-state pid controller should never lead to temperatures greater than 5 degress above setpoint!

## Sample bleeding-edge workings
- You can use the mqtt interface to export live data for monitoring purposes as can be seen in this [Grafana Dashboard](https://snapshot.raintank.io/dashboard/snapshot/lYe7XigrehSfVsvAWYifEwd2d5hNC0dl).

## Instructions on how to migrate from official rancilio to bleeding-edge
Installation is as explained on http://rancilio-pid.de/ but with following adapations:
1. Make screenshots of the official "Blynk App Dashboard" so that you can revert anytime.
1. Copy file userConfig.h.SAMPLE to userConfig.h and edit this file accordingly.
   - I propose to set MQTT_ENABLE=2 instead of blynk. But it is up to you.
     ```
     #define MQTT_ENABLE 2
     ```
1. Copy contents of folder ranciliopid\arduino-libs to your arduino sketchbook location (normally C:\Users\YOUR_NAME\Documents\Arduino)
   - Important: Open arduino IDE and configure the setting Tools->"lwip Variant" -> "1.4 High Bandwidth"
1. Flash and enjoy your espresso.
1. No tuning should be required normally. If you want/need to then use the method described below.

## Instructions on how to update to the latest version of bleeding-edge
1. Just overwrite all existing files with a newly released version.
2. Open your userConfig.h file, which had not been overwritten in previous step, and manually check (line by line!) that all updates to the new file userConfig.h.SAMPLE are reflected in your own userConfig.h. 
3. Compile, upload and enjoy!

    - while also supporting the switch types: toggles (eg switches) and triggers (eg push buttons)
    - added MQTT Support to control actions using topics ../actions/<ACTION> with supported payloads of 0|1|-1 (off|on|switch)
      Example: "custom/KÃ¼che.Rancilio2/actions/STEAMING"
  - Feature: Set userConfig.h ROTATE_DISPLAY to rotate display 180 degree.
  - Feature: BrewReadyLed (now called HardwareLed) configured with ENABLE_HARDWARE_LED also lights up when temperature>steamTemp or >STEAM_READY_TEMP.
  - Feature: OnlyPid=0: Disable pre-infusion and pause by setting userConfig settings to 0.
  - Feature: OnlyPid=1: BrewDetection can now also be triggered by hardware using actionControle "BREWING".
  - Feature: New userConfig setting SETPOINT_STEAM is also setable via [mqtt](https://github.com/medlor/bleeding-edge-ranciliopid/wiki/MQTT-Setup)/[blynk](https://github.com/medlor/bleeding-edge-ranciliopid/wiki/Blynk-Setup).
  - Feature: hardwareLed will glow for a few seconds when the machine starts up. This helps determine a not-starting node.
  - Feature: Additional safe-guard to temporary disable heater if temperature is 10 degree above active setPoint.
  - Important FIX: mqtt interface for STEADYPOWER_OFFSET_TIME working again. This setting is currenly wrongly set and need to be re-set for auto-tuning to work!
  - Fix: EMERGENCY_TEMP setting disables pid when temperature is > and re-enables when < setPoint. Please check your setting to be reasonable high (eg. Rancilio 135 degree). Should at least be higher than SETPOINT_STEAM.
  - Feature/Fix: New setting STEAM_READY_TEMP to show our special steaming-icon only when temperature is above.
    - There is support for special "in-steaming-state" icons, but I am in no mood to paint them yet. Feel free. 
  - BREWDETECTION_POWER is now in active right after a brew is detected and not when temp <1.5degree below setpoint.
  - Attention: Major userConfig adaptions. Create a backup!
    - BREAKING CHANGE:

    - Changed:
      - Default of userConfig EMERGENCY_TEMP from 125 to 128.
      - Default of userConfig TEMPSENSORRECOVERY from 1 to 0.
  - Sample Config for IoTMQTTPanel: IoTMQTTPanel-rancilio_v2.6.0_v1.json
  - Update ZACwire-Library to v1.1.3.
- 2.4.2 master:

  - Bugfix (MQTT_ENABLE=1): Auto-Tuning settings are persisted across restarts.
  - Bugfix: steadyPowerOffsetTime is configurable via mqtt.
  - Bugfix: aggoTn is now correctly published via mqtt.
  - Added new circuit-diagrams (Thanks Tempcookies + Helge).
  - MQTT code refactorings.
- 2.4.1 master:
  - It fixes some compiler errors and warnings I was seeing on my system. (Thanks nils-werner)

  - Bugfix: End of BrewTimer correctly displayed (OnlyPid)
  - Bugfix: No power-off countdown when brewing.
  - Move display stuff into separate files
  - alpha code: Intitial support for an user-menu (ENABLE_USER_MENU/pinBrewButton)
  - alpha code: Initial infos about how to add a case with hardware-buttons to control basic settings directly at machine.
- 2.3.0 master:
  - PID is completely auto-tuned and should work flawlessly after a few starts. No need to configure PID any longer. 
  - Bleeding-Edge settings can be configured remotely without requiring a running service (blynk, mqtt-server) running in your network or internet. (No extra raspi required)
    You can now freely choose which service you want to use:
    1. Standalone without any network connectivity
    2. MQTT Server (runs on bleeding-edge arduino) to not depend on a remotely running service
    3. MQTT Client to connect to an mqtt-services (eg used by smart-home software)
  - MQTT fully implemented so you can publish and subscribe to configure settings and monitor states.
  - THANKS: Added Adrian's library to efficiently read TSIC values (https://github.com/lebuni/ZACwire-Library)
  - ATTENTION: New default values in userConfig.h. 
    - It is recommended to intially use default values for STEADYPOWER, STEADYPOWER_OFFSET_TIME, STEADYPOWER_OFFSET, STARTTEMP, BREWDETECTION_POWER, BREWDETECTION_SENSITIVITY. Additionally BREWTIME is from now on also used in ONLYPID=1.
    - GPIO Pin Mapping moved to userConfig.h.
  - ATTENTION: Installation process changed. Libs must be installed as described in "Instructions on how to migrate from official rancilio to bleeding-edge 
    - Copy contents of folder ranciliopid\arduino-libs to your arduino sketchbook location (normally C:\Users\YOUR_NAME\Documents\Arduino)
  - Improve PID:
    - Auto-tuning for starttemp is implemented. No need to adapt the STARTTEMP accordingly when SETPOINT is modified
    - steadyPowerOffset is gradually decreased over time to better compensate the warm up of machine.
    - PID monitors and tunes steadyPowerOffset.
    - One time PID manipulation logic added.
    - PID's I parameter filter is reduced in certain situations more strictly.
  - BrewDetection optimized:
    - (ONLYPID=1) ATTENTION: The BREWTIME setting defines the time-frame of your "normal" brew (in seconds). 
       When a brew is detected, the brew_timer starts and runs until BREWTIME is reached. During that time
       the heater is heating with BREWDETECTION_POWER.
    - BREWDETECTION_POWER behaviour changed: 
      (ONLY_PID=0) The power is applied to heater during the complete brew process. 
      (ONLY_PID=1) The power is applied until the brew_timer is larger than BREWTIME or the current temperature is 1.5 Celcius below setpoint.
    - (ONLYPID=1) BREWDETECTION_WAIT setting added: After a brew is started the software based BrewDetection is disabled for this number of seconds to prevent the detection of another brew when flushing water.
    - (ONLYPID=1) Software BrewDetection estimates the starttime of a brew, so that the brew counter in display is correct. 
  - Debug Logs Improvements:
    - Add logs for brewReadyStatistic
    - When connecting by telnet/blynk the hardware- and software configuration is printed
  - Documentation Updates:
    - Enabled wiki at https://github.com/medlor/bleeding-edge-ranciliopid/wiki/
      - eg. Howto "Setup MQTT": https://github.com/medlor/bleeding-edge-ranciliopid/wiki/MQTT-Setup
    - Added link to sample daily Grafana dashboard.
  - Fix: userConfig.h: AUTH renamed to BLYNKAUTH
  - Fix: No starttemp tuning when when machine is already warm.
  - Fix: burstPower working again.
  - Fix: If PID is manually disabled, heater utilization is correctly reported as 0%.
  - Fix: Heater overextending handling working as intended.
  - Fix: Potential crash when toogling pid on/off
  - Fix: Save pidON in eeprom.
  - MQTT_ENABLE=1: Configuration retained in mqtt topics are now used on startup.
  - Code cleanup and refactorings
  - Trigger brewReady when temperature is stable for 60sec (prev: 40s).
- 2.2.0_master:
  - Display functionality improved:
    - Replaced display lib Adafruit_SSD1306.h with U8G2. Direct support for SH1106_128X64 and SSD1306_128X64 via userConfig.
    - Completly new display widgets which show informations according to active PID state.
    - Support for icon collections to easily customize/share display widgets. Icon collection "simple" and "smiley" included.
    - Support for simple icon animations.
    - Service Status Icons are displayed if enabled in userConfig.
    - New DEFINES in userConfig.h. Update your config.

  - Remove define EMERGENCY_TEXT.
  - Fix: PID State "brewing" is correctly detected when ONLYPID=0. (Thanks Helge)
- 2.1.0_master:
  - Networking:
    - Huge improvements in handling unstable WIFI networks and mqtt/blynk service unavailabilities.
    - You can disable/enable WIFI, MQTT or Blynk in userConfig.h and stil have a flawlessly working PID controller. Blynk is no longer an hard requirement!
    - Offline Modus is fixed and enhanced. If userConfig.h's FORCE_OFFLINE is enabled, then PID fully is working without networking. Ideal in situations when there is no connectivity or you dont want to rely on it.
    - Fix of EEPROM functionality: PID settings are correctly saved in EERPOM and correctly used if there are WIFI issues.
    - Instead of using dynamic IPs (over DHCPd) you have the option to set a static IP.
    - If blynk or mqtt is not working during startup, do not retry the connection periodically (configurable by userconfig.h DISABLE_SERVICES_ON_STARTUP_ERRORS)
  - New PID Variable "BREWDETECTION_POWER" introduced which defines the heater power during brewing.
  - Complete rewrite of "TSIC sensor read" based on the excellent ISR code by Adrian. (Thanks Adrian!)
    - Optimized "TSIC sensor read" to further increase performance.
    - Currently it takes <4ms to collect sensor data instead of the previous 78ms).
    - Fix: "sensor errors" do not occur anymore.
  - Performance/Stability:
    - Some system libs are optimized in performance and stability (src/ folder).
    - Remove all unneeded external libraries which are installed in system's arduino search path.
    - Code Tunings all over the place to increase performance and therefor stability.

- 1.9.8f:
  - Added missing config.h.SAMPLE variables.
  - Added some more mqtt events.
- 1.9.8e:
