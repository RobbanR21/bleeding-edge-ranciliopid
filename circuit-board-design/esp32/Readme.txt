ESP32 example PCB made by "Vas#3315" (Attention: this design is not tested)

Vas: I've tested the same design but for Arduino. Sure you can order it from China. 
I've ordered from PCBWay lately, but other guys used JLCPCB successfully. All the 
SMD components are on the top side, so any manufacturer who offers one side SMD 
assembly will work. I've built the BOM for LCSC, it's in the schematics.
